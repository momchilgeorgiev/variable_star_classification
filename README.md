# Variable Stars Classification. Use case for random forests

This project aims to classify variable stars from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using photometric data from the OGLE Collection of Variable Stars. The project focuses on three classes of variable stars: Classical Cepheids (CEPs), Eclipsing and Binary Stars (ECLs) and RR Lyrae (RRLYRs). The data for these classes was extracted from the LMC using the UPSILoN library.

The main objectives of the project are to:

* Extract photometric features from the time series data for the classes.
* Train a classifier on the data
* Evaluate the performance of the model on unseen data.
